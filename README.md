# Core Skills Examples
This repository holds all the examples from posts on https://coreskills.mmodrow.rocks.

## Structure
You can find a specific post's examples in `./YYYY/MM/DD_<slug>`. In the most cases each post will contain a separate solution with one project per example/context. If an example requires a separate solution there will be multiple folders with a solution within each one.

## Usage
All examples should be runnable via `dotnet run` or Visual Studio directly (or after restore & rebuild).
If that is not the case for one example there will be a `README.md` in the example's root directory.

## Contribution
I you find some error or have other feedback, please open an issue or a pull request and I will have a look at it.
